## oppgave 14: Multiple states (condition)

* Only show the content of inputValue when the button inside Alert> is clicked.
* When clicking the button in Alert> the value of inputValue should be what is written in the input> inside the Alert>.
* To do this you must have state (isClicked) in App.js that is updated when the button is clicked (true / false). The function that we use to update this state must be sent to Alert> so we can update / read its value.
* Use conditional around the p>{inputValue} p> to only write out the message when the button is clicked. Remove the value if we click the button another time.
